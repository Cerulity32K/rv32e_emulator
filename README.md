# RV32E Emulator
An executor library for RISC-V (`rv32e` variant) machine code.

See the `examples` folder for example usage.

This emulator has not been thoroughly tested and should not be relied upon for any practical application. The example `reverse` program executes without issue, but attempting to run anything else has the chance of failing due to emulation errors.

A more complete README is to come.
